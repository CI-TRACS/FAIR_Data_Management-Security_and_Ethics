Science works best by exchanging ideas and building on them. Most efficient science involves both questions and
experiments being made as fully informed as possible, which requires the free exchange of data and information.

All practices that make knowledge and data **freely available** fall under the umbrella-term of **Open Science/Open
Research**. It makes science **more reproducible, transparent, and accessible**. As science becomes more open, the way
we conduct and communicate science changes continuously.

> ## What is Open Science
>
> Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software)
> and its dissemination **accessible to all levels** of an inquiring society,
> amateur or professional.
>
> Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on **cooperative work**
> and new ways of diffusing knowledge by **using digital technologies** and new collaborative tools
>
> Open science is **transparent and accessible knowledge**
> that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.
>
> Characteristics:
> * Using web-based tools to facilitate information exchange and scientific collaboration
> * Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data
> * Public availability and reusability of scientific data, methods and communications

### What is the Open Science movement?

Sharing of information is fundamental for science. This began at a significant scale with the invention of scientific
journals in 1665. At that time this was the best available alternative to critique & disseminate research, and foster
communities of like-minded researchers.

Whilst this was a great step forward, the journal-driven system of science has
led to a culture of ‘closed’ science, where knowledge or data is unavailable or unaffordable to many.

The distribution of knowledge has always been subject to improvement.
Whilst the internet was initially developed for
military purposes, it was hijacked for communication between scientists, which provided a viable route to change the
dissemination of science.

The momentum has built up with a change in the way science is communicated to reflect what
research communities are calling for – solutions to the majority of problems (e.g. impact factors, data reusability,
reproducibility crisis, trust in the public science sector etc...) that we face today.

Open Science is the movement to increase transparency and reproducibility of research, through using
the open best practices.

### Open Science Building Blocks

* **Open Access:** Research outputs hosted in a way that make them accessible for everyone. Traditionally Open Access
  referred to journal articles, but now includes books, chapters or images.

* **Open Data:** Data freely and readily available to access, reuse, and share.
  Smaller data sets were often accessible as
  supplemental materials by journals alongside articles themselves.
  However, they should be hosted in dedicated platforms for
  more convenient and better access.

* **Open Software:** Software where the source code is made readily available;
  others are free to use, change, and
  share. Some examples of these including the coding language and supporting software R and RStudio,
  as well as image analysis software such as Fiji/ImageJ.

* **Open Notebooks:** Lab & notebooks hosted online, readily accessible to all. These are popular among some of the
  large funding bodies and allow anyone to comment on any stage of the experimental record.

* **Open Peer Review:** A system where peer review reports are published alongside the body of work. This can include
  reviewers' reports, correspondence between parties involved, rebuttals, editorial decisions etc...

* **Citizens Science:** Lay people become involved in scientific research, most commonly in data collection or image analysis. Platforms such as [zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/) help connect projects with lay people interested in playing an active role in research, which  can help generate and/or process data which would otherwise be unachievable by one single person.

* **Scientific social networks:** Networks of researchers, which often meet locally in teams, but are also connected online, foster open discussions on scientific issues. Online, many people commonly use traditional social media platforms for this, such as Twitter, Instagram, various sub-reddits, discussion channels on Slack/Discord etc..., although there are also more dedicated spaces such as [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/).

* **Open Education resources:** Educational materials that are free for anyone to access and use to learn from. These can be anything from talks, instructional videos, and explanations posted on video hosting websites (e.g. YouTube), to entire digital textbooks written and then published freely online.

* **Citizen science:** Citizen participation of various stages of research
  process from project funding to collecting and analysing data.

> ## Exercise 1: Benefits of Open Science (5 min)

> Being open has other outcomes/consequences beyond giving the free access to information.
> For example, Open educational resources:
> - enables collaborative development of courses
> - improves teachers/instructors skills by sharing ideas
>
> Select one or two of the following OS parts:
> * Open Access
> * Open Data
> * Open Software
> * Open Notebooks
> * Open Peer Review

>> ## Solution
>>
>> Possible benefits and consequences for each part:
>>
>> **Open Access**
>> * speed of knowledge distribution
>> * leveling field for underfunded sites which otherwise wouldn’t be able to navigate the paywall
>> * prevent articles being paid for ‘thrice’ (first to produce, second to publish, third to access) by institutions.
>> * greater access to work by others, increasing chance for exposure & citations
>> * access to work by lay audiences, thus increases social exposure of research
>>
>> **Open Data**
>> * ensures data isn’t lost overtime - reusability
>> * acceleration of scientific discovery rate
>> * value for money/reduced redundancy
>> * permits statistical re-analysis of the data to validate findings
>> * gives access to datasets which were not published as papers (e.g. negative results, large screening data sets)
>> * provides an avenue to generate new hypotheses
>> * permits combination of multiple data sources to address questions, provides greater power than a single data source
>>
>> **Open Software**
>> * great source to learn programming skills
>> * the ability to modify creates a supportive community of users and rapid innovation
>> * saves time
>> * faster bug fixes
>> * better error scrutiny
>> * use of the same software/code allows better reproducibility between experiments
>> * need funds to maintain and update software
>>
>> **Open Notebooks**
>> * 100% transparent science, allowing input from others at early stages of experiments
>> * source of learning about the process of how science is actually conducted
>> * allows access to experiments and data which otherwise never get published
>> * provides access to ‘negative’ results and failed experiments
>> * anyone, anywhere around the world, at any time, can check in on projects, including many users simultaneously
>> * possibility of immediate feedback
>> * thorough evidence of originality of ideas and experiments, negating effect of ‘scooping’
>>
>> **Open Peer Review**
>> * visibility leads to more constructive reviews
>> * mitigates against editorial conflicts of interest and/or biases
>> * mitigates against reviewers conflicts of interest and/or biases
>> * allows readers to learn/benefit from comments of the reviewers
>>
>> **Open Educational Materials**
>> * Foster collaboration between educators/others
>> * Show clearly how method was taught (e.g. Carpentries materials) which can be reproduces anywhere, anytime
>> * protects materials from becoming technologically obsolete
>> * authors preparing the material or contribute all earn credit (e.g. GitHub)
>> * recycle animations and material that is excellent (why reinvent the wheel?)

### Motivation: Money (8 min teaching)

One has to consider the moral objectives that
accompany the research/publication process: charities/taxpayers pay to fund research, these then pay again to access the
research they already funded.

From an economic point of view, scientific outputs generated by public research are a public good that everyone should be able to use at no cost.

According to EU report ["Cost-benefit analysis for FAIR research data"](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d375368c-1a0a-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1),
€10.2bn is lost every year because of not accessible data (plus additional 16bn if accounting for re-use and research quality).

The goals of Open Science is to make research and research data available to e.g.
charities/taxpayers who funded this research.

**COAlition S**, a group of national research funding organisations backed by
the European Commission and the European Research Council, is a big driver trying to get rid of the paywalls that our
research is sat behind. They announced Plan S, an initiative to make research publications fully free at the point of
access, meaning that all research funded by public funding bodies must be published Open Access from 2021 onwards.

> ## Open Access (a successful example)
>
> The majority of larger UK and other countries' funding bodies are now making
> Open Access publication conditional upon funding.
>
> The initiative is known as Plan S, which requires *“resulting
> publications available immediately (without embargoes) and under open licences, either in quality Open Access platforms
> or journals or through immediate deposit in open repositories that fulfil the necessary conditions.”*
>
> Exact requirements
> differ between funding bodies, with the minimum requirement being that a copy be deposited with your home institution.
>
> Details of funding bodies and their involvement and requirements can be found
> at [Plan S/cOAlition S](https://www.coalition-s.org/plan-s-funders-implementation/). There is also
> a [cOAlition S journal checker tool](https://www.coalition-s.org/blog/unboxing-the-journal-checker-tool/) to assess
> compliance being developed.
> The [Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org/) is a tool to find which journals are Open Access.

### Motivation: Reproducibility

The inherited transparency of Open Science and the easy access to data, methods and analysis
details naturally help to address the Reproducibility crisis. The openness of
scientific communications and of the actual process of evaluation of the research
(Open Peer Review) increase confidence in the research findings.

### Personal motivators

Open Science is advantageous to many parties involved in science (including
researcher community, funding bodies, the public even journals), which is leading to a push for the widespread adoption of
Open Science practices.

Large UK funding bodies such as The Wellcome Trust are big supporters of Open Science.
We can see with the example of Open Access, that once enforced by funders (*the stick*)
there is a wide adoption. But what about the personal motivators, *the carrots*.

(3 min teaching)

The main difference between the public benefits of Open Science practices
and the personal motivators of outputs creators, that the public can
benefit almost instantly from the open resources.
However, the advantages for data creator comes with a delay, typically counted
in years. For example, building reputation will not happen with one dataset,
the re-use also will lead to citations/collaboration after the next research
cycle.



### Barriers and risks of OS movement:


> ## Exercise 2: Why we are not doing Open Science already (4 min)
>
> Discuss Open Science barriers, mention the reasons for not already being open:

>> ## Solution
>> - sensitive data (anonymising data from administrative health records can be difficult)
>> - IP
>> - misuse (fake news)
>> - lack of confidence (the fear of critics)
>> - lack of expertise
>> - the costs in $ and in time
>> - novelty of data
>> - it is not mandatory
>> - lack of credit (publishing negative results is of little benefit to you)

(4 min teaching)

It may seem obvious that we should adopt open science practices, but there are associated challenges with doing so.

Sensitivity of data is sometimes considered a barrier.
Shared data needs to be compliant with data privacy laws, leading
many to shy away from hosting it publicly. Anonymising data to desensitise it can help overcome this barrier.

The potential for intellectual property on research can dissuade some from adopting open practices. Again, much can be
shared if the data is filtered carefully to protect anything relating to intellectual property.

Another risk could be seen with work on Covid19: pre-prints.
A manuscript hosted publicly prior to peer review, may
accelerate access to knowledge, but can also be misused and/or misunderstood. This can result in political and health
decision making based on faulty data, which is counter to societies’ best interest.

One concern is that opening up ones
data to the scientific community can lead to the identification of errors, which may lead to feelings of
embarrassment. However, this could be considered an upside - we should seek for our work to be scrutinized and errors to
be pointed out, and is the sign of a competent scientist.
One should rather have errors pointed out rather than risking
that irreproducible data might cause
even more embarrassment and disaster.

One of **the biggest barriers are the costs** involved in "being Open".
Firstly, making outputs readily available and usable to others takes time
and significant effort. Secondly, there are costs of hosting and storage.
For example, microscopy datasets reach sizes in terabytes,
making such data accessible for 10 years involves serious financial commitment.

### Get involved

Thankfully, incentive
structures are beginning to support Open Science practices:

* Universities signing up to the Declaration on Research
Assessment (DORA).
* Wellcome Trust funding proposals that increase Open Science
* Wellcome Trust asked for description of Open Science activities in the
grant application

You do not want to be left behind!
