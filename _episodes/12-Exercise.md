> ## Exercise: What aspect of this dataset are FAIR? (10 minutes)
> At bare minimum, any dataset can probably benefit from having the below information available:
> * a name/title
> * its purpose or experimental hypothesis
>
> Analyze the below dataset from HydroShare.
> [Hydroshare: LNWB Ch04 Climate Data](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2d58ac373e4f4174a3050a046aaf121e/)
>
>Use the [ARDC FAIR self assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/aboutdata/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/)
>
>> ## Solution
>> Some typical elements are:
>> * biological material, e.g. Species, Genotypes, Tissue type, Age, Health conditions
>> * biological context, e.g. speciment growth, entrainment, samples preparation
>> * experimental factors and conditions, e.g. drug treatments, stress factors
>> * primers, plasmid sequences, cell line information, plasmid construction
>> * specifics of data acquisition
>> * specifics of data processing and analysis
>> * definition of variables
>> * accompanying code, software used (version nr), parameters applied, statistical tests used, seed for randomisation
>> * LOT numbers
