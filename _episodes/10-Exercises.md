> ## Exercise: What aspect of this dataset are FAIR? (10 minutes)
> At bare minimum, any dataset can probably benefit from having the below information available:
> * a name/title
> * its purpose or experimental hypothesis
>
> Analyze the below dataset from HydroShare.
> [Hydroshare: LNWB Ch04 Climate Data](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2d58ac373e4f4174a3050a046aaf121e/)
>
>Use the [ARDC FAIR self assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/aboutdata/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/)
