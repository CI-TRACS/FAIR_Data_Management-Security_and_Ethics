## What is FAIR?

The FAIR principles for research data, originally published in a [2016 Nature
paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18), are intended as "a guideline for
those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings." This guideline
has subsequently been endorsed by working groups, funding bodies and
institutions.

FAIR is an acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.

- Findable: others (both human and machines) can discover the data
- Accessible: others can access the data
- Interoperable: the data can easily be used by machines or in data analysis workflows.
- Re-usable: the data can easily be used by others for new research

The FAIR principles have a strong focus on "machine-actionability". This means
that the data should be easily readable by computers (and not only by humans).
This is particularly relevant for working with and discovering new data.

> ## What the FAIR principles are **not**
>
> - A standard: The FAIR principles need to be adopted and followed as much as
>   possible by considering the research practices in your field.
>
> - All or nothing: making a dataset (more) FAIR can be done in small,
>   incremental steps.
>
> - Open data: FAIR data does not necessarily mean openly available. For
>   example, some data cannot be shared openly because of privacy
>   considerations. As a rule of thumb, data should be *"as open as possible, as
>   closed as necessary."*
>
> - Tied to a particular technology or tool. There might be different tools that
>   enable FAIR data within different disciplines or research workflows.
