Hello everyone, and welcome to the **FAIR Data Management Security and Ethics** workshop.

## Better research by better sharing

For many of us, data management or output sharing in general
are considered a burden rather than a useful activity. Part of the problem
is our bad timing and lack of planning.

**Data management is a continuous process**

## When should you engage in data sharing and open practices?
* Data management should be done throughout the duration of your project.
* If you wait till the end, it will take a massive effort on your side and will be more of a burden than a benefit.
* Taking the time to do effective data management will help you understand your data better and make it easier to find when you need it (for example when you need to write a manuscript or a thesis!).
* All the practices that enable others to access and use your outcomes directly
benefit you and your group

In this workshop we will discuss how your research outputs can be made readily available for re-use by others.
