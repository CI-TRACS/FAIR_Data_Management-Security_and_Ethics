Hello everyone, and welcome to the **FAIR in biological practice** workshop.
We are very pleased to have you with us.

## Better research by better sharing

For many of us, data management or output sharing in general
are considered a burden rather than a useful activity. Part of the problem
is our bad timing and lack of planning.

**Data management is a continuous process**

When should you engage in data sharing and open practices?
* Data management should be done throughout the duration of your project.
* If you wait till the end, it will take a massive effort on your side and will be more of a burden than a benefit.
* Taking the time to do effective data management will help you understand your data better and make it easier to find when you need it (for example when you need to write a manuscript or a thesis!).
* All the practices that enable others to access and use your outcomes directly
benefit you and your group

In this workshop we will show you how you can plan and do your research
in a way that makes your outputs readily available for re-use by others.

Our agenda:
* **Seminar**
- Explain Open Science principles and what the benefits are of being open for you and society.
- Talk about FAIR principles which define steps you/we should take so that our "shared" outputs are of value.
- A brief introduction to metadata and ontologies, and how to be precise to deliver FAIR outputs.
- Examples of how public repositories make  outputs accessible and reusable other tools can help you during your research.
- We will talk about Version Control.
- We will consolidate our knowledge of FAIR ready data management and what

* **Exercises**
- How to use metadata in Hydroshare, and the benefits of using online records for documenting experiments.
- We will talk about working and organizing files and appropriate file naming conventions using Excel or CSV tables to store and document data.
- We will teach how to describe your projects using simple text files or customized templates.
